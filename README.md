### Additional notes
On \*BSDs (including macOS), you'll need GNU/make (`gmake`) to install this
script.

## Installation
### From source (recommended)
1. `git clone https://owo.codes/whats-this/owo.sh.git owo.sh`
2. `cd owo.sh`
3. `git checkout REV` where `REV` is a release. Current latest is `v1.0.0`
4. `sudo make install`. If you want to avoid use of `sudo`, you can install
   script to the home of the current using by doing `make install
   PREFIX=$HOME/.local/`

## FAQ
**Screen recording on macOS?**<br/>
[No.](https://owo.codes/whats-this/owo.sh/issues/26)

**Symbol Lookup Error on Ubuntu 17.xx**<br/>
Build from source or upgrade.
[maim/issues/120](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim/issues/120).

**Wayland support?**<br/>
No. To elaborate, Wayland quite *literally* does not support screenshots.
It is simply too "secure" to allow such things. Please use Xorg instead.
